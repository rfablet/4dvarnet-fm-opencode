# Changelog

## 2026-06-30: Initialize opencode project guidelines

**Summary:** Added AGENTS.md, opencode.json, and initial CHANGELOG.md to establish a consistent workflow for opencode sessions.
**Files modified:**
- `AGENTS.md` — new: project guidelines with session workflow, commands, conventions
- `opencode.json` — new: project opencode config referencing PLAN.md and CHANGELOG.md
- `.gitignore` — removed `opencode.json` exclusion so the config can be committed
- `CHANGELOG.md` — new: implementation log
**Rationale:** Ensure every opencode session follows a consistent workflow: read PLAN.md, implement, verify, log changes.

## 2026-06-30: Add experiment plan for τ=0 CFM ablation

**Summary:** Created `docs/experiment_G_tau0_cfm.md` documenting a proposed experiment to test whether VanillaCFM's advantage over DirectUNet comes from multi-τ training or from the residual loss formulation.
**Files modified:**
- `docs/experiment_G_tau0_cfm.md` — new: experiment plan with motivation, code changes, configs, and expected outcomes
**Rationale:** Plan to isolate the effect of random τ sampling by training VanillaCFM with τ=0 only and comparing RMSE against full CFM (F1-F3) and DirectUNet (E2).

## 2026-06-30: Add CS3/CS4 randomized-parameter test cases

**Summary:** Extended the benchmark with two new test cases (CS3/CS4) that apply per-window parameter randomisation (param_noise=0.2) to CS1/CS2 dynamics. Fixed a coupling_type bug in baseline evaluation (CS2/CS4 need "quartic"). Added unified `evaluate_all.py` script and updated report generation and documentation.
**Files modified:**
- `data/lorenz63.py` — `make_mixed_datasets()` now accepts `include_randparam_test` and `param_noise`; returns `RandomParamLorenz63Dataset` for test_cs3/test_cs4
- `conf/schema.py` — added `test_randparam` and `test_param_noise` fields to `DataConfig`
- `evaluation/run.py` — extended `_BASELINE_CASES` to include cs3/cs4 with coupling_type; created per-coupling-type baseline pool (linear/quartic)
- `train.py` — evaluate on CS3/CS4, save trajectories, extend results.json with fm_cs3/fm_cs4 entries
- `evaluate_all.py` — new: unified script that runs baselines + loads trained CFM models and produces comparison table
- `reports/generate_unet_cfm_report.py` — added CS3/CS4 columns to metrics table, bar charts, per-component breakdown, and conclusion
- `docs/case_studies.tex` — added CS3/CS4 sections with equations and description
**Rationale:** CS3/CS4 test generalisation to unseen random parameter draws at evaluation time, complementing the CS1/CS2 fixed-parameter tests. The coupling_type fix ensures correct forward model in baselines for quartic cases.
**Verification:** Pending — will run `pytest tests/ -v` and `ruff check .` after next session's experiments.
